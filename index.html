                    <p><strong>Hi everyone my name is Mohan Kulapati!  I am the Head Coach of the ABC Program.  
                        My passion is to help people change their lives in the simplest and most realistic way possible. 
                        I believe everyone deserves the right to good health and to be happy with themselves inside and out.
                         Getting fit and healthy does not have to be difficult, but often times it is.</p>
                    <p>I want to work with you to find YOUR formula! I coach you DAILY for the duration of the program and we work as a team.  
                        I am your navigator but you are the captain of the ship.  I help guide you along but ultimately you make all the 
                        decisions in your journey. I work with your likes, avoid your dislikes and try to shape your behavior, habits and 
                        mindset so that you can become consistent and committed to the process.  This enables you to have realistic, 
                        consistent and sustainable progress. 
                        We find something that is fun and easy to do.  When it is fun and easy you will want to repeat it.  
                        When you want to repeat it, then it becomes habit.  And when it becomes habit then it is part of your lifestyle.</p>

                            My trainer Mohan tailored the sessions to meet my specific rehabilitation needs. He had a thorough understanding of how the body works

                            feeling exhilarated. The sessions were held close to my work and Mohan was very flexible with availability times.
